-------------Docker Commands----------------

1. sudo docker pull "image_name": Pulls the image from docker hub
2. sudo docker images: "shows the list of images available on local machine"
3. sudo docker run -it -d  "image_name" : run the docker image which is eventually a docker container. (A running instance of an image is a docker container)
	Here -it refers to Interactive Terminal, which means we are making the container session interactive.
	     -d refers running the image in the background.
4. sudo docker exec -it "container_id" bash : This allows us to get access into the container and make it interactive. we use bash in the end as it is a bash terminal we are working with.
5. sudo docker ps: list down running docker containers
6. sudo docker ps -a: list down all the docker containers, running or not running
7. sudo docker stop "container_id" : stops the running container
8. sudo docker kill "container_id" : forcefully stops the running container
9. sudo docker rm "container_id" removes the container
10. sudo docker rmi "image name" : removes the image from local machine.
11. sudo docker commit "container_id" "new image name" : this will create new image for current container id with the changes u have made.
12. sudo docker rm -f $(sudo docker ps -a -q) : short cut to remove all containers in one command.
13. sudo docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' "Container_id"
14. sudo docker run -it -p 82:80 -d "image_name" : This command helps in enabling port 80 for host OS, as apache runs on port 80.
Flag -p here is for port enabling.
